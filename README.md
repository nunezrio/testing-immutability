# Immutability and Testing Lab

**Task**: The app is complete except for some TODOs in the vote service. You must use TDD to complete those four methods. Write two tests for each method. The first method already has two tests, but one of them fails.

All changes should be in `vote.service.spec.ts` and `vote.service.ts`.

To start tests run:

`ng test`
